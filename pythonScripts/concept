CLIENT -> SERVER comms contain <client_data> that is stored on the server side (mysql) later to be read/viewed via PHP/mysql/whatever
	ex1. client is a humidity/temperature sensor that sends its data
SERVER -> CLIENT comms contain <client_data> that should affect in some way the client
	ex1. client is a light dimmer and <client_data> is 0-255 PWM information
	ex2. servers is pooling the client for data (xxFF call)


client1	<->
client2	<-> RPi(python) -> RPi(mysql)
client3	<->
...	<->

			RPi(php) <- RPi(mysql)


!!! clients talk(somehow)(two-way comm)[nrf24l01?] to server(RPi) in encoded messages that contain <client_id> and <client_data>

every client has a unique 4-byte address split in 2-byte chunks
	xxFF should be the client device address
	FFxx should be the sensor address attached to that client
	"xxFF" should be reserved for client pooling (requesting the data for all available sensors on that client)
		ex.
		arduino1 is 02 and all sensors connected to it have addresses starting with 02xx
		arduino2 is F5 and all sensors connected to it have addresses starting with F5xx
